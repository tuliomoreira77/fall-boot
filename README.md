# FallBoot

This project is a simple Dependency Injector/IoC Container for Java.  
Wait a minute!! Doesn't Java already have very good dependecy injection frameworks? Yes, I'm using this project just to pratice some skills!  

After all it works and it is small.

## Features
- Automatic dependency injection
- Post injection method execution

## Getting started 
1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file
```xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
      <id>jitpack.io</id>
      <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```
2. Add the dependency
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.User</groupId>
    <artifactId>Repo</artifactId>
    <version>Tag</version>
</dependency>
```
