# FallBoot

This project is a simple Dependency Injector/IoC Container for Java.  
Wait a minute! Doesn't Java already have dozens "Gold" Dependecy Injector based Frameworks? Yes, I'm just reinventing the wheel here, for fun!  
But it works and it is small.

For now is just it, someday I will update this Readme with the instructions to use it (if you want to use a shit framework).
